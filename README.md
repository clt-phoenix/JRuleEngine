# JRuleEngine

This project is a fork of the [JRuleEngine](http://jruleengine.sourceforge.net) project that is currently hosted on SourceForge. 

From their project page:

JRuleEngine is java rule engine, based on Java Specification Request 94, release 1.1. 
Please see "Java Rule Engine API - JSR-94" document (file jsr94_spec.pdf) included in JSR-94 distribution: that document explains how to use a library based on these specifications, like this one. 

This fork of JRuleEngine adds a number of new capabilities:

* Ability to use JSON for the rules file.
* Ability to use interface references in synonyms.
* Ability to enable/disable rules.
